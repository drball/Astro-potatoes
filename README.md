# Astro-potatoes

Assets folder of a Unity project with 2D assets. 
This is a working prototype, created for my brother's birthday with intention to develop further into an actual game. 
You can control a spaceman, get into a drivable van, collect items, talk to NPCs, get out of the van, get into a spaceship, fly spaceship.
