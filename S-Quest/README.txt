Dear customer,

Thank you for buying S-Quest!

To learn how to use S-Quest system please check the online documentation: http://soumidelrio.com/document/s-quest/
If you still have questions, don't hesitate to contact me:

The Quest UI has been created by Jorge Avila: http://opengameart.org/content/gui-for-some-rpg-game

S-Quest is fully compatible with S-Inventory (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/10749)
which is an inventory, merchant, equipment, crafting and skill bar system!
If you own both of the assets, take a look at this: http://soumidelrio.com/document/s-quest/quest-creation/ so you can learn how to reward a player with S-Inventory items.

Cheers,
