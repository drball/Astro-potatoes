Thank you for buying the S-Inventory. Please consider rating and reviewing the asset!

The first thing to do is to delete one of the C# and JS folders and keep the folder you need.

Please make sure you check the online documentation to learn how to use S-Inventory: http://soumidelrio.com/document/s-inventory/

The Inventory UI has been created by Jorge Avila: http://opengameart.org/content/gui-for-some-rpg-game

S-Inventory is fully compatible with S-Quest (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/14409)
which is a missions/quest builder.
If you own both of the assets, take a look at this: http://soumidelrio.com/document/s-quest/quest-creation/ so you can learn how to reward a player with S-Inventory items.

If you still need more help or have suggestions for future updates, contact me here:
